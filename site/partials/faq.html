	<h2>How do I find video sources for custom channels?</h2>
	<p>This question has two parts that depend on the source you are trying to get.  One is easier, and the other is more technical.  Which way you choose depends on what channel you are trying to add.</p>
	
	<h3>The Easy Way</h3>
	<p>The easy way to accomplish this is if the source you are trying to add makes the .m3u8 link available on their website.  If this is the case, simply follow the example below for your channel, and you are good to go.</p>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h4>Step 1</h4>
		<p>The first step is to navigate to the site of your choice (in this case <a href="jblive.tv">jblive.tv</a>), and locate the "HLS" stream.</p>

		<h4>Step 2</h4>
		<p>Next, copy that link into the video source url box, and ensure that the link ends with .m3u, mp4, .mkv or .m3u8.</p>
